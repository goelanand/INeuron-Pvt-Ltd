The data are provided with 26 columns of numbers, separated by spaces. 
Each row is a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle, each column is a different variable. 

## The columns correspond to:
1) unit number

2) time, in cycles

3) operational setting 1

4) operational setting 2

5) operational setting 3

6) sensor measurement 1

7) sensor measurement 2

â€¦

26) sensor measurement 26
